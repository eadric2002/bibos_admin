* Version 2.2.1, February 3, 2014

New in this version:

- Package lists are only synchronized between client and server if number of
  updates changes (solves performance issue cf. ticket #9611).
- Design bug when adding to long list of groups fixed, cf. ticket #9097.
- Crash when trying to sort job list under PC fixed (ticket #9548).
- Developer documentation updated and improved.


* Version 2.2.0, December 27, 2013

New in this version:

- Stale locks are avoided by introducing Unix-style file locking instead.
  Previously, a crashed job would leave a dangling log on the client computers,
  which in turn would cause the job manager to terminate immediately, because
  it thought that another instance was running. This meant that the admin
  system would lose all contact with the machine and the lock had to be removed
  manually for the admin system's control with it to resume - yielding bugs
  such as #9320. With the new locking style, a lock set by a process will always
  disappear when the process terminates. This means that crashing jobs can no
  longer cause a client computer to lose contact with the admin server.

This is the first "final release" following the critical bug fixes in the 2.1.*
series, and this version concludes the first phase of the BibOS Admin project.


* Version 2.1.2, December 23, 2013

New in this version:

- Performance problem in jobs list is solved by allowing user to choose between
  different lengths (cf. ticket #9301).
- Status label to be shown translated on PC job lists (ticket #9339).
- Stay on selected PC even if it's in the bottom of a very long list of
  computers (ticket #9342).


* Version 2.1.1.3, December 17, 2013 (hotfix)

New in this version:

- bibos-client fixed so that it always sends status info - not only when jobs
  are executed, cf. ticket #9634.
- Server fixed so that packages pending for installation are always installed,
  even if we ask the client to upgrade its package info - also cf. #9634.


* Version 2.1.1.1, December 4, 2013

New in this version:

- The system defined "wanted packages" as packages in the *distribution*
  plus/minus the packages that were explicitly added or removed through the
  admin interface. This means that packages that were installed manually or
  through a script on the individual computer would be removed because they
  were neither in the distribution nor in the add list, and packages in the
  distribution that were removed on the individual computer would be added.

  Since the gateway needs a number of packages that were not added through the
  admin interface, this means it was basically nuked as soon as the
  synchronization started working, as we've seen with ticket #9383.

  From now on, the system will define "wanted packages" as *all packages
  currently present on the machine* plus all packages explicitly added in the
  admin system, minus all packages explicitly removed through the admin system.

  This creates a new problem, namely that packages which were added (or removed)
  through a group will no longer be automatically removed (or added,
  respectively) when a computer is removed from the group. That should probably
  be dealt with by a special field which specifies whether a package was added
  through group membership and should be removed if it's no longer demanded by
  any group. This is a task for a future version of the system.


* Version 2.1.1, November 25, 2013

New in this version: 

- File parameters were renamed when running scripts more than once, #9100.
- User interface bug would hide group list if a group had many computers in it,
  #9097.
- Major overhaul of user interface.
- Update synchronization improved (not fixed).


* Version 2.1.0, October 11, 2013

New in this version:

A lot of bugs have been fixed, and the design has been thoroughly
polished. 

A brief summary:

- Spaces and other special characters are now allowed (though discouraged, 
  in the case of spaces *strongly* discouraged) in URLs.
- JQuery is hosted locally and not loaded from another host.
- "System" site is added to host system scripts.
- Scripts to install LibreOffice 4 and Oracle's Java are added.
- The documentation has been finished.
- Technical documentation in source code is included on the admin site as
  well.
- Localization infrastructure is introduced to permit translation (currently
  Danish is only supported locale).
- Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license has been added for
  the documentation.
- bibos-client has been changed to support wireless networks.
- System now supports fixed gateway/proxy configured by IP address, not just
  auto-detection.
- Computers may be deleted from the admin system.
- Only superadmins may edit global scripts.

Executive summary:

- Status moves from "beta" to "production".
